# Water Files
A nice little file hosting site made in php.

# Hosting Your own
To host your own, grab the [SQL file](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/895454866984534089/1000587853341917224/stuff.sql) and import that into the database of choice.
Now, go to config.php and change the sql credentials to your own. If yours needs a password add password=(pass here); to config.php.
